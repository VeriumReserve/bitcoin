Verium Core
=============

Intro
-----
Verium is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Download the [installation file](https://cdn.vericonomy.com/verium/Verium_0.16_64bit.exe) and launch it

Verium Core is the original Verium client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Verium transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Take a look at the general Readme.md to find how to speed it up with the bootstrap system
